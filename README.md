# WineQualityPrediction

### Dataset:
The two [datasets](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Wine+Quality) contain two different characteristics which are physico-chemical and sensorial of two different wines (red and white), the product is called "Vinho Verde". The datasets are taken from **UCI Machine Learning Repository**.

There are 1599 samples of red wine and 4898 samples of white wine in the data sets. Each wine sample (row) has the following characteristics (columns):

-  Fixed acidity
-  Volatile acidity
-  Citric acid
-  Residual sugar
-  Chlorides
-  Free sulfur dioxide
-  Total sulfur dioxide
-  Density
-   pH
-   Sulphates
-  Alcohol
-  Quality (score between 0 and 10)

### Abstract:

Given a set of input paramters such as pH, Alcohol etc, this project aims at predicting the quality of wine by categorizing it under the following user friendly labels:
-  Low
-  Average
-  High

we aim to do so by trying different predictive algorithms and coming up with the right one based on the results.
